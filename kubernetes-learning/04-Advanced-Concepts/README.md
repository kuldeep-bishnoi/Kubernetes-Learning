# Advanced Kubernetes Concepts

This directory contains information about advanced Kubernetes concepts that build upon the core Kubernetes objects.

## Contents

1. [Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)](./01-horizontal-pod-autoscaling/) - Automatically scales the number of pod replicas based on observed CPU utilization or other metrics.
2. [Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA)](./02-vertical-pod-autoscaling/) - Automatically adjusts the CPU and memory reservations for pods to better match their resource needs.
3. [Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) & Operators](./03-custom-resources-operators/) - Extend Kubernetes API with custom resources and controllers.
4. [Helm Charts & Package Management](./04-helm-charts/) - Package, share, and deploy Kubernetes applications.
5. [Monitoring & Observability](./05-monitoring/) - Monitor and observe Kubernetes clusters and applications using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
6. [Multi-Cluster Management](./06-multi-cluster/) - Manage and orchestrate workloads across multiple Kubernetes clusters.
7. [Service Mesh](./07-service-mesh/) - Implement service-to-service communication, security, and observability with service mesh technologies.
8. [GitOps & CI/CD Pipelines](./08-gitops-cicd/) - Implement continuous delivery and GitOps workflows for Kubernetes.
9. [Policy Management](./09-policy-management/) - Enforce policies across your Kubernetes environment.
10. [Kubernetes Scheduling](./10-scheduling/) - Advanced pod scheduling techniques and practices.

## Learning Path

For those who have mastered the core Kubernetes objects, we recommend exploring these advanced concepts in the following order:

1. **Start with Autoscaling** - Understand how to automatically scale your applications horizontally and vertically.
2. **Explore Custom Resources & Operators** - Learn how to extend Kubernetes with custom resources and automation.
3. **Implement Helm** - Discover how to package and deploy applications using Helm.
4. **Set up Monitoring** - Implement observability solutions for your clusters and applications.
5. **Implement Service Mesh** - Add advanced service-to-service communication capabilities.
6. **Explore GitOps** - Implement continuous delivery and GitOps workflows.
7. **Set up Policy Management** - Enforce policies across your Kubernetes clusters.
8. **Customize Scheduling** - Fine-tune pod scheduling for specialized workloads.
9. **Manage Multiple Clusters** - Scale your Kubernetes environment across multiple clusters.

Each section contains detailed documentation and practical examples to help you implement these advanced concepts in your Kubernetes environments.
