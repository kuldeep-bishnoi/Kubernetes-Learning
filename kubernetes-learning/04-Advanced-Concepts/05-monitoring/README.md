# Kubernetes Monitoring & Observability

This directory contains information and examples related to monitoring and observability in Kubernetes environments.

## Overview

Monitoring and observability are critical aspects of managing Kubernetes clusters. They provide insights into the health, performance, and behavior of your applications and infrastructure, helping you:

- Detect and diagnose problems quickly
- Understand resource usage and optimize costs
- Track the performance of applications and services
- Make data-driven decisions about scaling and capacity planning
- Ensure compliance and security requirements are met

## Key Components of Kubernetes Observability

Observability in Kubernetes typically includes:

1. **Metrics** - Numerical data about system and application performance
2. **Logs** - Detailed records of events and actions
3. **Traces** - Records of requests as they flow through distributed systems
4. **Events** - Significant state changes or notifications from Kubernetes

## Common Monitoring Stack

A typical Kubernetes monitoring stack includes:

### Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit that:
- Collects and stores time-series metrics
- Provides a flexible query language (PromQL)
- Uses a pull-based model to scrape metrics from targets
- Includes built-in alerting capabilities

### Grafana

Grafana is a visualization and analytics platform that:
- Creates dashboards with metrics from multiple data sources
- Provides rich visualization options (graphs, tables, heatmaps)
- Supports alerting and notifications
- Offers template variables for dynamic dashboards

### Loki

Loki is a log aggregation system designed for Kubernetes that:
- Uses the same label-based approach as Prometheus
- Is highly scalable and efficient for storing and querying logs
- Integrates seamlessly with Grafana

### Jaeger/OpenTelemetry

Distributed tracing systems that:
- Track request flows across multiple services
- Help identify performance bottlenecks
- Provide insights into service dependencies

## Kubernetes-Native Monitoring

Kubernetes itself provides monitoring capabilities through:

### kube-state-metrics

Adds cluster-level metrics such as:
- Deployment status and replicas
- Pod status and resource requests/limits
- Node capacity and allocatable resources

### Metrics Server

Provides the core metrics used by the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler:
- CPU and memory usage for nodes
- CPU and memory usage for pods

### Kubernetes Dashboard

A web-based UI to monitor and manage Kubernetes clusters.

## Setting Up Monitoring

There are several approaches to setting up monitoring in Kubernetes:

1. **Manual Installation** - Deploy each component separately
2. **Helm Charts** - Use Helm to deploy monitoring stacks
3. **Operators** - Use the Prometheus Operator or similar tools
4. **Managed Services** - Use cloud provider monitoring solutions

## Best Practices

### Resource Monitoring

- Monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network usage at node and pod levels
- Track resource requests vs. actual usage
- Set up alerts for resource saturation

### Application Monitoring

- Implement custom metrics for application-specific states
- Use the Prometheus client libraries for your language
- Expose an HTTP endpoint for metric scraping

### Log Management

- Use structured logging (JSON)
- Include relevant metadata in logs (service name, request ID)
- Implement log rotation and retention policies

### Alerting

- Define meaningful alert thresholds
- Reduce alert noise with proper tuning
- Implement different severity levels
- Ensure alerts are actionable

### Dashboard Design

- Create purpose-specific dashboards (cluster overview, application-specific)
- Use consistent layouts and naming
- Include documentation within dashboards

## Important Metrics to Monitor

### Cluster-Level Metrics

- Node resource usage (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Pod count and distribution
- Persistent volume usage
- Control plane component health

### Application-Level Metrics

- Request rate, errors, and duration (RED)
- Service level objectives (SLOs)
- Business-specific metrics
- Dependency health

### System-Level Metrics

- Container resource usage
- Network connectivity and latency
- Disk I/O and latency
- System load and process counts
