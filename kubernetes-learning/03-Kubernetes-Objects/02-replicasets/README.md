# Kubernetes ReplicaSets

## What is a ReplicaSet?

A **ReplicaSet** is a Kubernetes controller that ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. It is the next level of abstraction above Pods.

ReplicaSets are responsible for:
- Maintaining a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time
- Ensuring the specified number of Pods are available
- Replacing Pods that fail, are deleted, or are terminated

Think of ReplicaSets as a self-healing mechanism that maintains the desired state of your application.

## How ReplicaSets Work

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     ReplicaSet                          │
│                                                         │
│  ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐ │
│  │     Pod      │   │     Pod      │   │     Pod      │ │
│  │              │   │              │   │              │ │
│  └──────────────┘   └──────────────┘   └──────────────┘ │
│                                                         │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The ReplicaSet controller continuously monitors the cluster and performs the following actions:

1. **Watch**: Monitor the current state of Pods with matching labels
2. **Compare**: Check if the number of running Pods matches the desired count
3. **React**: 
   - Create new Pods if there are too few
   - Remove excess Pods if there are too many

## Core Components of a ReplicaSet

1. **Selector**: Labels used to identify which Pods are managed by the ReplicaSet
2. **Replicas**: The desired number of Pods to maintain
3. **Pod Template**: The template used to create new Pods

## When to Use ReplicaSets

### Appropriate Use Cases

✅ **Simple Replication Requirements**: When you need multiple identical Pods without advanced update features
✅ **Static Workloads**: Applications that don't change frequently and don't require rolling updates
✅ **Custom Controllers**: When building your own controllers that manage ReplicaSets
✅ **Specific Use Cases**: When you need precise control over pod scaling without rollout management

### When to Use Deployments Instead

❌ **Modern Applications**: Most applications should use Deployments, which manage ReplicaSets
❌ **Rolling Updates**: If you need rolling updates and rollbacks
❌ **Declarative Application Updates**: When you want a higher-level abstraction for updates

> **Best Practice**: In most production environments, you should use Deployments instead of directly using ReplicaSets. Deployments provide additional features like rolling updates and revision history.

## Creating a ReplicaSet

### YAML Definition

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-replicaset
  labels:
    app: nginx
    tier: frontend
spec:
  # Number of replicas
  replicas: 3
  
  # Pod selector
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  
  # Pod template
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.21
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### Applying the ReplicaSet

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-replicaset.yaml
```

## Managing ReplicaSets

### Checking ReplicaSet Status

```bash
# List all ReplicaSets
kubectl get replicasets

# Get detailed information about a ReplicaSet
kubectl describe replicaset nginx-replicaset
```

### Scaling a ReplicaSet

You can scale a ReplicaSet by changing the number of replicas:

```bash
# Imperative approach
kubectl scale replicaset nginx-replicaset --replicas=5

# Declarative approach - modify the replicas field in the YAML file
# and then apply it
kubectl apply -f nginx-replicaset.yaml
```

### Deleting a ReplicaSet

```bash
# Delete the ReplicaSet and its Pods
kubectl delete replicaset nginx-replicaset

# Delete only the ReplicaSet, not the Pods (use with caution)
kubectl delete replicaset nginx-replicaset --cascade=false
```

## ReplicaSet Selectors

ReplicaSets use label selectors to identify which Pods to manage. There are two types of selectors:

### MatchLabels

The simplest and most common selector type:

```yaml
selector:
  matchLabels:
    app: nginx
```

### MatchExpressions

More complex and powerful selector syntax:

```yaml
selector:
  matchExpressions:
  - {key: app, operator: In, values: [nginx, nginx-web]}
  - {key: environment, operator: NotIn, values: [dev]}
```

Available operators:
- `In`: Label value must match one of the specified values
- `NotIn`: Label value must not match any of the specified values
- `Exists`: Pod must have a label with the specified key
- `DoesNotExist`: Pod must not have a label with the specified key

## Pod Ownership and Acquisition

ReplicaSets manage Pods that match their selector. There are two ways a Pod can become part of a ReplicaSet:

1. **Created by the ReplicaSet**: The ReplicaSet creates Pods from its pod template
2. **Adopted by the ReplicaSet**: Existing Pods with matching labels are adopted

When a ReplicaSet creates Pods, it adds an `ownerReference` in the Pod's metadata that points back to the ReplicaSet, establishing ownership.

## ReplicaSet vs. Replication Controller

ReplicaSets are the newer and recommended way to manage replicated Pods, replacing the older Replication Controller:

| Feature | ReplicaSet | Replication Controller |
|---------|------------|------------------------|
| API Version | apps/v1 | v1 |
| Selector Support | Set-based (matchLabels, matchExpressions) | Equality-based only |
| Adoption Policy | More flexible | Limited |
| Usage | Recommended | Legacy |

## Difference between ReplicaSets and Deployments

| Feature | ReplicaSet | Deployment |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Purpose | Maintain a stable set of replica Pods | Provide declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets |
| Update Strategy | None (manual updates) | Rolling updates, recreate |
| Rollback | Not supported directly | Supported with history |
| Revision History | Not maintained | Maintains revision history |
| Scaling | Basic scaling | Scaling with additional controls |
| Use Case | Low-level control | Recommended for most use cases |

## Advanced ReplicaSet Concepts

### Non-Template Pod Acquisitions

ReplicaSets can acquire Pods that weren't created from their template, as long as they match the selector:

```bash
# Create a pod with labels matching the ReplicaSet selector
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: custom-nginx
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.22
EOF
```

### Removing Pods from a ReplicaSet

You can remove a Pod from a ReplicaSet by changing its labels:

```bash
kubectl label pod <pod-name> app=not-nginx --overwrite
```

Note: The ReplicaSet will create a new Pod to replace the one that no longer matches.

### Pod Disruption Budgets with ReplicaSets

To protect your application's availability during voluntary disruptions, use Pod Disruption Budgets:

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: nginx-pdb
spec:
  minAvailable: 2  # or maxUnavailable: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
```

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### ReplicaSet Not Creating Pods

Possible causes:
- Resource constraints in the cluster
- Issues with the Pod template
- Selector mismatch

Troubleshooting:
```bash
kubectl describe replicaset <replicaset-name>
```

### Pods Created but Not Running

Possible causes:
- Container image issues
- Resource limits
- Node problems

Troubleshooting:
```bash
kubectl describe pods -l app=nginx
```

### Multiple ReplicaSets Managing the Same Pods

If multiple ReplicaSets have overlapping selectors, it can lead to conflicts.

Troubleshooting:
```bash
# Find all ReplicaSets with potentially overlapping selectors
kubectl get replicasets --show-labels
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Deployments**: In most cases, use Deployments instead of directly creating ReplicaSets
2. **Specific Selectors**: Use specific and non-overlapping selectors
3. **Resource Limits**: Always specify resource requests and limits in the Pod template
4. **Health Checks**: Include readiness and liveness probes
5. **Pod Anti-Affinity**: Consider using pod anti-affinity to spread replicas across nodes
6. **Labels**: Use meaningful labels to organize and identify your resources

## Examples

### Basic ReplicaSet

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: basic-rs
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
```

### ReplicaSet with Advanced Selector

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: advanced-rs
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchExpressions:
    - {key: app, operator: In, values: [web, nginx]}
    - {key: environment, operator: NotIn, values: [production]}
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web
        environment: staging
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
```

## Exercises

1. **Create a Basic ReplicaSet**:
   - Create a ReplicaSet with 3 nginx Pod replicas
   - Verify the Pods are running
   - Experiment with changing the replica count

2. **Test ReplicaSet Self-Healing**:
   - Delete one of the Pods managed by the ReplicaSet
   - Observe how the ReplicaSet automatically creates a replacement

3. **Pod Acquisition**:
   - Create a Pod with labels matching the ReplicaSet selector
   - Observe how the ReplicaSet adopts or ignores this Pod

4. **Test Label Changes**:
   - Change the labels on one of the Pods managed by the ReplicaSet
   - Observe how the ReplicaSet reacts

## Next Steps

Now that you understand ReplicaSets, move on to [Deployments](../03-deployments) to learn about more advanced workload management with rolling updates and rollback capabilities.
